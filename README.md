# JellyfinSpotifyFavorites

After importing my Spotify Playlist into Lidarr, I wanted to get a playlist in Jellyfin, which also only shows my liked songs and not all albums.

I created this little python script, to fetch all songs from a specified Playlist from Spotify and then favoriting the songs found in Jellyfin.
